<workgroup>Domain Name System Operations (dnsop) Working Group</workgroup>
<abstract>
<t>This document states clearly that when a DNS resolver receives a
response with status code NXDOMAIN, it means that the name in the
question section AND ALL THE NAMES UNDER IT do not exist.</t>
</abstract>
</front>

<middle>
  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction and background">
    <t>In virtually all existing resolvers, a cached NXDOMAIN is not
    considered "proof" that there can be no child domains
    underneath. This is due to an ambiguity in <xref
    target="RFC1034"/> that failed to distinguish ENT (empty
    nonterminal domain names, <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-terminology"/>) from nonexistent names.  For DNSSEC,
 the IETF had to distinguish this case (<xref target="RFC4034"/>, section 3.1.3.2), but the implication on non-DNSSEC resolvers wasn't fully realized.</t>
<t>This document dictates that NXDOMAIN means NXDOMAIN for all child domains. Since the
domain names are organized in a tree, it is a simple consequence of
the tree structure: non-existence of a node implies non-existence of
the entire sub-tree rooted at this node.</t>
</section>

<section title="Rules">
<t>When searching downward in its cache, an iterative caching DNS
resolver SHOULD stop searching if it encounters a cached NXDOMAIN.
The response to the triggering query should be NXDOMAIN.</t>
<t>When an iterative caching DNS resolver stores an NXDOMAIN in its
 cache, all names and RRsets at or below that node SHOULD be deleted
since they will have become unreachable.</t>
<t>By implication, a stream of queries foo.example, bar.foo.example where
foo.example does not exist would normally cause both queries to be
forwarded to example's nameservers. Following this recommended practice,
the second query and indeed any other query for names at or below
foo.example would not be forwarded.</t>
</section>

<section title="Benefits">
  <t>The main benefit is a better efficiency of the caches. In the
  example above, we send only one query instead of two, the second one
  being answered from the cache.</t>
  <t>The correct behavior (in <xref target="RFC1034"/> and made
  clearer in this document) is specially useful when combined with QNAME
  minimisation <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-qname-minimisation"/> since it will allow to
  stop searching as soon as a NXDOMAIN is encountered.</t>
  <t>TODO help with random QNAME attacks TODO reference</t>
  <t>TODO discussion of the SHOULD vs. MUST for the resolvers: some
  resolver may have a cache which is NOT organized as a tree (but, for
  instance, as a dictionary) and
  therefore have a good reason to ignore this.</t>
</section>

<section title="Possible issues">
  <t>TODO Paul Wouters on isolated domains</t>
<t>Today, we see broken authoritative name servers which reply to ENT
(<xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-terminology"/>, section 6) with
NXDOMAIN instead of the normal NODATA (<xref
target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-terminology"/>, section 3).</t>
<t>RFC-EDITOR: REMOVES THE PARAGRAPH BEFORE PUBLICATION. An example today is
mta2._domainkey.cbs.nl (which exists) where querying _domainkey.cbs.nl
yields NXDOMAIN. Another example is
www.upenn.edu, redirected to www.upenn.edu-dscg.edgesuite.net while a
query for edu-dscg.edgesuite.net returns NXDOMAIN.</t>
<t>Such name servers are definitely broken and have always been. They MUST be fixed. Given
the advantages of NXDOMAIN cuts, there is little reason to support
this behavior.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Future work">
  <t>TODO a word on deducing the non-existence of a node from the SOA
  in the NXDOMAIN reply? Could help with random qnames attack</t>
</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>This document has no actions for IANA.</t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>TODO mention random qnames attacks and how t stop them by
"poisoning" the resolver with a NXDOMAIN for the apex</t>
</section>

<section title="Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION">

<t>This section records the status of known implementations of the
protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in <xref
target="RFC6982"/>. The description of implementations in this section
is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information
presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not
intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
implementations or their features.  Readers are advised to note that
other implementations may exist.</t>
<t>According to <xref target="RFC6982"/>, "this will allow reviewers
and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have
the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups to use this
information as they see fit".</t>
<t>TODO As of today, all existing DNS resolvers are conservative: they
consider a NXDOMAIN as only significant for the name itself, not for
the names under. All
current recursive servers will upstream a query for out-of-cache
sub.example.com even if their cache contains an NXDOMAIN for
example.com.</t>
